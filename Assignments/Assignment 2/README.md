Question </br>
Revisit your Shape Program from Homework 1.Write this program again (with the same requirements as the original) in a different OO language than you used the first time. Consider anything from an OOAD perspective that you’ve learned or thought about that you should change in this version.Include those changes in your code’s comments and your README file

Solution </br>
1. We have chosen Python to implement the above Question. </br>

2. From implementation perspective the difference we observed was that, the overriding of the existing sort method was simpler in Python than in Java. We had to include the python lambda function to override the sort function (which calls the area function of the respective subclass) and sorts the shapes based on the area. </br>

3. Main Class creates list of Shape Objects, calls the SortShapes() function and DisplayShapes() function.</br>

Instruction to run the file: python Shapes.py
